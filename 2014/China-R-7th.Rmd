The 7th China R Conference (Beijing session) was held in Renmin University of China (RUC), Beijing, from May 24th to 25th, 2014. The conference was organized by Capital of Statistics (COS, http://cos.name ), an online statistical community in China together with Center for Applied Statistics of RUC, the School of Statistics of RUC, and the Business Intelligence Research Center of Peking University. 

Chinese R Conference is the largest event for Chinese R users and developers. Every year, people from all over the country gather together for techniques in using R, knowledge of R packages, real cases of R usage, as well as topics on statistics, machine learning, and the big data industry. This bi-annual event takes place once in Beijing in summer and once Shanghai in winter. This time in Beijing, more than 900 people attended this conference for 33 talks, 6 lightening talks and one panel discussion, for free. 

The conference took place in Rulun Auditorium on the first day. There were 9 talks, followed by a panel discussion on big data industry and education. The panel discussion gathers Kai Yu from Baidu Institute of Deep Learning, Hansheng Wang from Peking University, Xizhi Wu from Renmin University, Changrong Du, Chief Data Officer of Youku Tudou, Yuan Yao from Peking University, Hao Hu from Quanttech, and Jiang Chang from Taiwan National University to a heated discussion about the buzzing of the phrase big data. The diversity of the speakers gave rise to some refreshing ideas. The second day of the conference consist of 24 talks in 3 parallel sessions. In each session, talks are grouped by themes.
